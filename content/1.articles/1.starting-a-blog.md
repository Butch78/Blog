## G'day, I'm Matthew 🏌️‍♂️

I have never been strong at writing so where better to learn than to write a blog!

### About me

I play golf, I write Python code and I am trying to become proficient in Rust. I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia 🦘. I am currently doing my Masters in Informatics (Software Systems) at the University of Zurich with a minor in Banking and Finance.

### Why I am writing this blog?

Well who wants to listen to some sub-par musings from a Developer? Well I'm not sure but I thought it would be fun to write about my experiences and to work on my Rust & writing skills. I am planning on building a Rust application to eventually host this blog on and give others the ability to write their own blogs. As a Student I would like to incorporate my studies into this blog and write about the things I am learning.

### Who inspired me to write this blog?

I found [Fast than Lime](https://fasterthanli.me/) and I thought it was a great idea to write about the things you are learning and to share your experiences. I also found the idea of writing a blog in Rust very interesting and I wanted to give it a go.
