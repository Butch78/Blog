## G'day, I'm Matthew üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

During this semester break I have been working on a project called Fruit Cards. It is an AI Learning platform that I have been working on for a while now and I thought I would share my progress with you.

At the current state it is a Vuejs application that uses a FastAPI Backend. The information is stored in a Supabase database. Here is the Fancy landing page for the project [Fruit Cards üçâ](https://fruit.cards)

 I have been using Docker to run the application. This blog post goes through the process of deploying the application to Cloudflare and AWS.

## The Idea üçâ

Users are able to upload their content, which will then be converted into an Index Tree and loaded into a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4. The LLM is then queried to create a Fruit Card deck. This will save students time when studying and allow them to learn more efficiently. In the future users will be able to query the LLM to ask questions about the content.

## The Application

The application is a Vuejs application that uses a FastAPI backend. The information is stored in a Supabase database. The application is deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. The application is deployed to AWS using Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Cloudflare for the frontend.

## Deployment Process

At the moment my frontend is deployed to Cloudflare and I am in the process of deploying the backend to AWS ESC. I will be using a Docker Image to deploy the FastAPI Application.

## Future Iterations

In the future I will be adding the following features:

- Refactor the backend to be a Rust ü¶Ä Axum backend hosted on Shuttle üöÄ
- SurrealDB for the database
- Tauri for the desktop and mobile application
